PHP Performance Optimization Techniques
Understand the execution process of PHP functions to optimize performance
In PHP, a function is the basic unit for executing code, and its execution process includes four stages: function call, parameter passing, execution of the function body, and return value. Understanding this process is crucial for performance optimization. For example, during a function call, PHP needs to find the function definition and transfer program control, which incurs a certain performance overhead. Therefore, it is necessary to be clear about this when writing code for optimization.

Specific optimization techniques
Reduce the number of function calls
Function calls themselves have performance overhead, and unnecessary function calls should be minimized. Repeated calculations can be avoided by caching function results. The example code is as follows:

php
复制
// 缓存函数结果
$cache = [];
function getCachedResult($input) {
    global $cache;
    if (!isset($cache[$input])) {
        // 一些耗时的计算
        $result = // 具体计算过程;
        $cache[$input] = $result;
    }
    return $cache[$input];
}
In this example, an array $cache is used to store the results that have already been calculated. When the result for the same input is needed again, it is directly retrieved from the cache, avoiding repeated calculations.

Optimize the recursive algorithm
Recursive algorithms are effective in handling complex problems, but improper use can lead to performance issues. The following methods can be adopted for optimization:

Use tail recursion optimization: Place the recursive call at the end of the function to reduce the depth of the function call stack. For example, a tail-recursion-optimized factorial function:

php

复制

function factorialTailRec($n, $acc = 1) {
    if ($n <= 1) {
        return $acc;
    }
    return factorialTailRec($n - 1, $n * $acc);
}
Convert to Loop: Convert the recursive algorithm to a loop implementation to avoid the overhead of recursive calls. For example, a factorial function implemented with a loop:

php

复制

function factorialLoop($n) {
    $result = 1;
    for ($i = 2; $i <= $n; $i++) {
        $result *= $i;
    }
    return $result;
}
Loop Optimization
Utilize static variables and constants: Static variables and constants retain their values between function calls and can be used to reduce repeated calculations and resource consumption.

Select appropriate data structures and functions: Improve efficiency at the algorithm level. For example, use array_slice() and array_splice() to handle array slicing instead of reallocating a new array. The sample code is as follows:

php
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12];
$subset = array_slice($array, 0, 10);
Optimize code structure
Reduce the use of global variables: Using global variables causes the PHP engine to read these variables on each function call, thereby reducing the performance of the application.

Avoid using a large number of passive function calls in loops: Calling a large number of functions in a loop will lead to repeated function calls, which will cause the function call stack to grow and affect performance.

Avoid using PHP code in HTML code: If PHP code needs to be used, it is recommended to place the PHP code in a separate script for processing, which is convenient for debugging and can improve performance.

Reduce database operations
Use multi-table joint query: Multi-table joint query is usually faster than single-table query because one joint table query can obtain data from multiple tables at one time.

Use indexes to optimize database queries: Using indexes speeds up database queries and avoids the database scanning the entire table.

Use caching to cache database query results: Solutions such as Memcached and Redis can be used to cache query results in memory for fast querying.

Use caching to improve performance
Use APC (Alternative PHP Cache) or OPCache to cache PHP scripts: APC and OPCache can cache the compilation results of PHP scripts, reduce script compilation time, and improve the performance of PHP applications.
